          <p>
          I am a father of two boy, that learned multiple skills across life. I have lived in several cities in some countries, falling in love with Sweden since i first came in 2016.
          I have learned programming by a fullstack developer Bootcamp in Craft Academy, in GÃ¶teborgs. I love to code and i also love to learn more inside of this ever changing field.
