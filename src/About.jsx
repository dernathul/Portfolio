          <p>
          I am a father of two boys, who has learned multiple skills across life. I have lived in several cities in different countries, falling in love with Sweden since I first came for vacations in 2013, since 2016 with my wife we moved here to start a family.
          I have learned programming by a fullstack developer Bootcamp in Craft Academy, in GÃ¶teborgs. I love to code and its applications, but i also love to learn more about this ever changing field. 
          I have published two short stories books in spanish, had my own restaurant in Chile and meet amazing people along life. I have many friends and i try to always leave a positive footprint in them, with my positive atitude and my way to be.
          </p>
