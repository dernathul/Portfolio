          <p>
          I am a father of two boys, who has learned multiple skills across life. I have lived in several cities in different countries, falling in love with Sweden since i first came in 2016.
          I have learned programming by a fullstack developer Bootcamp in Craft Academy, in GÃ¶teborgs. I love to code and its applications, but i also love to learn more about this ever changing field.
